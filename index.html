            <h2>Chuff</h2>
            <p>Chuff is a 6 year old Standard Poodle who I compete with in Agility, Canicross and Dock Diving.
               He sports a less common historical hairstyle known as cords. Poodle hair is naturally water resistant and
               was traditionally allowed to cord for maintenance purposes giving them more protection against the cold waters
               while they worked. 
               Plus it just looks cool and suits his wild personality.

            <h2>Shredder</h2>
            <p>Shredder is a 5 year old Standard Poodle who is kept in a more traditional poodle trim, we do this as he is 
               regularly used for commercial work and can be seen in pet shops on shampoo bottles! He was my first dog to get into
               commercial work with and it is such a rewarding and fun experience, plus we get to really put our obedience training to
               the test (and who can resist that handsome face)

            <h2>Java</h2>
            <p>Java is our most recent addition, he is a 3 month old Löwchen, a rare breed of dog (in the 1970's there were less than 70 of them left in the world!)
               A companion breed whose name is German for 'little lion,' the Löwchen has been a popular pet among Europeans for more than 500 years, even 
               having been seen in Renaissance art of several countries and popular among noblewomen. 
               As he grows older he will compete in Conformation, Agility and may even appear in a commercial or two.
